## 🔍 Overview

The **Automated Tarpaulin Protection System** is a prototype designed to prevent **mid-transit theft** of goods such as:

- Coal  
- Sand  
- Cement  
- Grains  
- Construction materials  

Unauthorized individuals often open the tarp during transport to steal material.  
This system aims to eliminate that problem by enabling:

✔ Authorized tarpaulin opening  
✔ Secure automated closing  
✔ Real-time status detection  
✔ Mechanized rolling & unrolling  
✔ Scalable motorized structure  

This prototype simulates a **truck-mounted tarpaulin automation mechanism**, built entirely from scratch using:

- **NEMA17 stepper motors**  
- **TB6560 stepper drivers**  
- **MG995 high-torque servos**  
- **Arduino Mega**  
- **Custom 3D-printed mechanical parts**  
- **Lead screws + sliding carriage**
